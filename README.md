# Credit Approval Prediction Using CNN

This project demonstrates a comprehensive application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in predicting credit card approval status, focusing on detailed steps from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The dataset covers demographic and financial information relevant to creditworthiness.

## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and predict credit card application approvals using convolutional operations in a deep learning framework, with a focus on feature transformation and CNN-based classification.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- **Demographic Details:** Gender, Age, Ethnicity, etc.
- **Financial Indicators:** Debt, Income, Credit Score, etc.
- **Employment & Default History:** Prior default, Employment status, etc.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the distribution and characteristics of each feature, including marital status, bank customer status, income, and debt levels.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling categorical data through encoding, feature scaling, and reshaping data to fit CNN input requirements.
3. **CNN Model Design:** Applying convolutional layers to extract patterns from the dataset for accurate prediction.
4. **Model Training:** Training the CNN with validation to optimize accuracy and generalization.
5. **Evaluation & Visualization:** Testing model performance on unseen data and visualizing accuracy and loss trends across epochs.

## Key Results
- **Training Accuracy:** The model achieved around 88-89% accuracy during training.
- **Validation Accuracy:** Consistently reached ~87-88%, indicating effective generalization.
